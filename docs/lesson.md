# READ() FUNCTION

The signature of the read() function is as follows:
```bash
#include <unistd.h>

ssize_t read(int fd, void *buffer, size_t count);
```

The parameters of the read() function are:

- `FD`: This is the file descriptor from which the data should be read. A file descriptor is an integer that identifies an open file or another type of input data stream. For example, 0 represents standard input (stdin), 1 represents standard output (stdout), and 2 represents standard error (stderr). File descriptors are typically obtained using functions like open() or socket().
- **buffer**: This is a pointer to the buffer where the read data will be stored.
- **count**: It specifies the maximum number of bytes to read from the file descriptor.
The read() function returns the number of bytes read from the file descriptor. If the returned value is -1, it indicates a read error.
